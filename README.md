# angularQuiz
A quiz app that has been repurposed to have an angular front end and small bits of node and mongo.

It is based off a project idea done during the the "How to Learn javascript Properly" guide found here: http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/

I have anothe repository containing that code and I wanted to convert it to a MEAN based app.
This is the first part on my way there, there is only a little node, express and mongo, unneeded but lays the groundwork
for what will be needed later.
